#### From Haejung (Project Manager):
To find the room, take the elevator to the 2nd floor from the building entrance on 251 E Huron. Then you will see a customer service desk. Ask for visitor’s hallway to the room 2-715. (You can get a parking permit from me at the event if you need)

### Agenda 
* Presentation by Tech Core


### Meeting mission
Dear friends,

As the SCRIPT study starts to kick into a higher gear, we will begin to have monthly meetings of the entire SCRIPT team. Each of the Cores and Projects will take turns presenting findings, analysis plans/strategies, roadblocks, and potential opportunities/new directions. This is a large multifaceted project and these meetings will be a great opportunity to get a bigger picture, similar to what we experienced with the NIAID site visit.

The meeting will be held every 3rd Thursday and Haejung Shin will send out an invitation. We would particularly like to facilitate participation by our Evanston colleagues. Please encourage your lab members, collaborators and other interested parties to come.

In addition, we now have a SCRIPT Study wiki and will have a SCRIPT Website for additional resources and updates.

Thank you again for all your participation.

Sincerely,\
Rich
